# Restaurant Coordination App

This is a responsive web application where users can enter the place where they where or where they want to eat. Then, they can see a list of restaurants located in that place with details on star rating, how much it costs to eat there, contact number and address.

This is built with HTML, Sass, React, Redux, Redux-Thunk, React-Bootstrap, Mongoose and ExpressJS. It also uses Yelp API as our source of the restaurants.

## Few Reminders
On adding ports, port should be the same with the port client is using, in the twitter app details callback and details of callback in the server file (in this case, index.js inside app/routes folder). Ports in the Navigation component should be the same with the port server is using.

Navigation, Express - 3001
React, In Twitter App (callback) - 3000
